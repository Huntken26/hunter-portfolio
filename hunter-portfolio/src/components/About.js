          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
          In 2022 I joined a Full Stack Developer Bootcamp and cultivated many skills including: 
          JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js, Bulma, Bootstrap, Angular, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, MySQL.
           I've also learned other technologies including: Heroku, GitHub/ GitLab, Canva and so on. I have an eye for concise code. 
            I also have a creative side. I love being able to curate the experience of a web application. As a result I am currently learning some UX/UI principles so that I can further explore these aspects as a Web Developer. I am very enthusiastic in the workplace and I love to encourage others to reach their potential as wellðŸ“ˆ.
